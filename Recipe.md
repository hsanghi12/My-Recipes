# Recipe

### Step 1:- Pour 1 1/2 cups warm water into a large bowl; sprinkle with yeast and let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes.

### Step 2:- Whisk sugar, oil, and salt into yeast mixture. Add flour and stir until a sticky dough forms. Transfer dough to an oiled bowl and brush top with oil. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and set aside in a warm, draft-free place until dough has doubled in bulk, about 1 hour. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and gently knead 1 or 2 times before using.

### Step 3:- Dough can be stored in an oiled bowl, covered with plastic, in refrigerator up to 2 hours. To freeze, wrap dough in plastic and freeze in a resealable freezer bag up to 3 months. If you plan to use it in a recipe that calls for half a batch, divide it before freezing.

### Step 4:- Take the dough out and roll it into a circle and puff out the edge of the dough so the crust is thicker at the edge.

### Step 5:- Pre-heat oven to 250-260Â°C. (Remember to put a plate in the oven).

### Step 6:- Put on the pizza sauce, cheese, and toppings.

### Step 7:- Put the pizza on the plate in the oven.

### Step 8:- Bake for 30 minutes or until pizza is crispy and golden brown (make sure you don't burn the toppings).

### *Try putting the toppings on the pizza differently to make the pizza look cool! (you can also change the shape of your pizza such as square or triangle).
